                    <h4>Charge Blade</h4>
                    <p>One of the best weapon in the game. If you want to hunt monsters as fast 
                        as possible, this is the weapon for you. This weapon stocks charges everytime
                        a monster is hit and can discharge it for increase attack damage. It can be 
                        difficult to get use to it but once you get the hang of it, it can minimise
                        your hunting speed.

                    <h4>Great Sword</h4>
                    <p>Great swords are very powerful weapons with a large damage cap that specialises 
                        in charge attacks which maximises your damage output. Due to its size, it is a 
                        very slow weapon but compensates on the amount of damage you can make for a three 
                        consecutive charge attacks and can also be used as a shield with the cost of 
                        your stamina.

                        types of coating such as elemental coatings which increases your damage and 
                        status effect coatings that causes abnormal status to monsters. Charge attacks

                <div class="details">
                    <h4>Long Sword</h4>
                    <p>Long swords are more agile and quicker compared to great swords but cannot be used
                        as shield during those crucial moments when a monster attacks which takes us to its
                        next benefit the counter slash. When timed correctly it can deflect monster attacks.
                        Long sword can also be charged by each attack which increases weapon damage depending
                        on the glow color.

                        mount a monster. It has a fluid attack combo on both ground and aerial. It also consist
                        of a kinsect that can be sent to a target to collect essence that increases your attributes
                        depending on the color collected and green essence that slightly restore your health.

                <div class="details">
                    <h4>Dual Blade</h4>

                    <h4>Hammer</h4>
                    <p>Hammer is a blunt weapon that is able to stun monsters. Just like the great sword it is capable of charge attacks
                        that increases its damage upon impact. In a slope, it is capable of an aerial spinning attack that can cause monsters
                        to be mounted. Note: If your in a party with a hammer user they usually target the head of a monster so leave them 
                        in charge in that area.
