                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Develop by CAPCOM, the latest installment to the Monster Hunter series. Monster Hunter World is a role-playing game
                    available in Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC.</p>
                <p>Immerse yourself to the New World where you will hunt new monsters and collect information for every single one of 
                    them and complete your monster ecology.Investigate the mountain dragon Zora Magdaros' migration and all new environment 
                    in story mode</p>
                <p>So grab yourself a palicoe and explore what this New World has to offer.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="info">
                <p>Hunt monster using different types of weapon and collect parts to craft a more powerful equipment. Equip your palicoes
                    with crafted monster parts that will get them stronger during your adventure.</p>
                <p>Four-player coop is also available where you can team up with your friends or other players. Send an SOS to get help 
                    from other players if you find a hunt very difficult.</p>
                <p>Hunt in a tactical fashion using gadgets and items avialable. Use your environment against a monster to and take them down.</p>
                <p>As a long time fan, this is one of the best gameplay I really enjoyed because it is not about how powerful your gears or
                    weapons are that makes you a good player. It's about practice and experience on how to hunt certain types of monster because
                    even with a strong gear you will still faint and occationally fail a quest</p>
                <p>The best and most important aspect of this game are the monsters. How every single one of them are created in a very detailed
                    fashion. Every move set and actions complements on what their designs are and you just can't help yourself to be mesmerised
                    on how they were designed.</p>
                <p>If you enjoy a tactical but enjoyable gameplay this is the game for you. It may take a few "faints" and "quest failed" but once
                    you get the hang of it and really try to learn the mechanics you will find how amazing this game really is.</p>
                <p>"So let's roast all them raw meats and make a ton of welldone steak because you will need alot of stamina when you 
                    join us for a hunt"</p>
